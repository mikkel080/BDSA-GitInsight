# Development Goals

This document details the goals and procedures for the development of the software.
This outlines what how we wish to work and organize within the team, not what the product or service does.

## Repository Cleanup

Once a week, often during the start of the week, we wish to clean up the repository and project board.
Specifically we wish to do the following:

* Clean the repository of unused, stale, branches
* Clean the Kanban Board of done tasks into an archive

## Test harness

Ideally all pull requests also contain new tests to validate the implemented features.
In addition the project is driven in a Test Driven style.

## Documentation

Ideally all pull requests also contain new tests to validate the implemented features.
If that is not possible, the individual authors should document their own design and interface.
